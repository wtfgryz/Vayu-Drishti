**Vayu-Drishti** (Sanskrit for *Air Vision*) is an end-to-end Big Data Analytics pipeline designed to monitor, analyze, and forecast Air Quality Index (AQI) levels for major Indian metropolises.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the **4 V's of Big Data** (Volume, Velocity, Variety, Veracity) using real-world sensor data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).

* **Ingestion:** Automated hydration of Data Lakes using CPCB datasets.
* **Processing:** ETL pipelines using **Apache Spark** to handle massive sensor logs.
* **Analytics:** Machine Learning (**Linear Regression**) to forecast AQI trends through 2026.
* **Visualization:** Interactive command-center dashboards using **Plotly**.

## 📊 Key Features
* **Strategic Roadmap:** AI-driven forecasting of pollution trends (2015–2026).
* **Seasonality Audit:** Detection of the "Monsoon Effect" on particulate matter.
* **Veracity Matrix:** A heatmap to audit sensor uptime and data gaps.
* **Risk Gauge:** Real-time risk assessment for specific wards.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Core:** Python, PySpark
* **Machine Learning:** Spark MLlib
* **Visualization:** Plotly Express, Plotly GO
* **Environment:** Google Colab / Local Jupyter Notebooks
